# 📌 K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Model

## Project Overview
This project implements a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classification/regression model using **Python** and **scikit-learn**. KNN is a simple, yet powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks.

## 🔍 How KNN Works
- **Instance-based learning:** The model memorizes the training data and makes predictions based on similarity.
- **Prediction:** For a new data point, it identifies the 'k' nearest neighbors and predicts the output based on majority voting (classification) or averaging (regression).
- **Distance Metric:** By default, Euclidean distance is used.

## ✅ Features
- Configurable **k** value.
- Supports **Euclidean distance**.
- Train-test split for evaluation.
- Performance metrics: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, etc.
- Visualizations for decision boundaries and results.

## 📊 Dataset
- **Source:** [Iris dataset or your custom dataset]
- **Features:** [List key features]
- **Target:** [Describe target variable]

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-knn-project.git
   cd your-knn-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the model**
   ```bash
   python knn_model.py
   ```

4. **View results**
   - Check terminal for output metrics.
   - Plots and predictions are saved in the `results/` folder.

## 📈 Example Results
